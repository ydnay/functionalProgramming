/*
Working with Arrays
The Array is Javascript's only collection type. Arrays are everywhere. We're going to add the five functions to the 
Array type, and in the process make it much more powerful and useful. As a matter of fact, Array already has the map, 
filter, and reduce functions! However we're going to reimplement these functions as a learning exercise.

This section will follow a pattern. First we'll solve problems the way you probably learned in school, or on your 
own by reading other people's code. In other words, we'll transform collections into new collections using loops and 
statements. Then we'll implement one of the five functions, and then use it to solve the same problem again without 
the loop. Once we've learned the five functions, you'll learn how to combine them to solve complex problems with 
very little code. The first two exercises have been completed in advance, but please look them over carefully!

// Traversing an Array
// Exercise 1: Print all the names in an array

const names = ["Ben", "Jafar", "Matt", "Priya", "Brian"];
const traverseArr = function(arr) {
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
  }
}

traverseArr(names);
